Projects

M.Tech Project:

Real-Time Monitoring of Points of Common Coupling in Distribution Systems through State Estimation:
* Modelled a distribution Network.
* Performed Root-vector-based Algorithm for observability test for IEEE 34 bus system to add Pseudo Measurements in the system.
* Implemented and compared results of the Forward/Backward sweep algorithm and Improved the Load flow method of the IEEE 34 bus distribution system.
* Implemented state estimation in the distribution system using the weighted least squares method.
* Identified bad data using the collinearity test.
* Identified unplanned reactive and active power inputs at PCC to prevent the grid from isolating itself without a system fault.
* The results were assessed and compared to the planned power injections.
* These estimated and recognized unscheduled power injections at PCC were caused by natural calamities that affected distribution networks.

B.Tech Project:

Energy audit at (KPT) Kulkarni Power Tools Ltd., Shirol
* Studied the electrical systems and types of load connected.
* Measured the Power factor and total harmonic distortion (THD) of a company using a power analyser device.
* Created the same type of load and total harmonic distortion (THD) level using Silumink in MATLAB.
* Designed an active filer on MATLAB to improve the overall power factor.

Awards and Achievements

* National Institute of Technology, (NIT), Warangal, GATE Scholarship (Aug 2015 – May 2017)
* Qualified in electrical engineering GATE 2014-15 & 2017-18
