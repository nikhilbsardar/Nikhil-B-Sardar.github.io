**PROJECTS**

*M.Tech Project:*\
Real-Time Monitoring of Points of Common Coupling in Distribution Systems through State Estimation:
* Modelled a distribution Network.
* Performed Root-vector-based Algorithm for observability test for IEEE 34 bus system to add Pseudo Measurements in the system.
* Implemented and compared results of the Forward/Backward sweep algorithm and Improved the Load flow method of the IEEE 34 bus distribution system.
* Implemented state estimation in the distribution system using the weighted least squares method.
* Identified bad data using the collinearity test.

* Identified unplanned reactive and active power inputs at PCC to prevent the grid from isolating itself without a system fault.
* The results were assessed and compared to the planned power injections.
* These estimated and recognized unscheduled power injections at PCC were caused by natural calamities that affected distribution networks.
