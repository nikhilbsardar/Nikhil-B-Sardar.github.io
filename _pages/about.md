Introduction

* A Doctor of Philosophy aspirant with a strong interest in power electronics for electric vehicles (EVs) and a substantial
understanding of the field.
* My research and patent work has helped me improve my skills in EVs, which I am enthusiastic about.
* Proficiency in MATLAB Programming and Simulink 

Education

| M.Tech Electrical Power System Engineering | National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India |(CGPI: 8.2/10 | May’ 2017
|B. Tech: Electrical Engineering | Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli|GPI: 7.42/10 | June’ 2013

Projects

M.Tech Project:
Real-Time Monitoring of Points of Common Coupling in Distribution Systems through State Estimation:
Guide Name: Dr. Sydulu Maheswarapu
* Modelled a distribution Network.
* Performed Root-vector-based Algorithm for observability test for IEEE 34 bus system to add Pseudo Measurements in the system.
* Implemented and compared results of the Forward/Backward sweep algorithm and Improved the Load flow method of the IEEE 34 bus distribution system.
* Implemented state estimation in the distribution system using the weighted least squares method.
* Identified bad data using the collinearity test.
* Identified unplanned reactive and active power inputs at PCC to prevent the grid from isolating itself without a system fault.
* The results were assessed and compared to the planned power injections.
* These estimated and recognized unscheduled power injections at PCC were caused by natural calamities that affected distribution networks.
